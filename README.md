# Tactile graphics

This is a compilation of tactile graphics created using [TactileView](http://www.tactileview.com/) at the [New York Public Library (NYPL)](https://www.nypl.org/about/locations/heiskell).

For more about the [Dimensions program](https://www.nypl.org/about/locations/heiskell/dimensions) at the NYPL, read their blog post [Announcing Dimensions: Community Tools for Creating Tactile Graphics & Objects](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2017/10/18/dimensions-tactile-graphics-objects).

# Files

Each folder has a `.bpx` file which you can load into TactileView. Most will also include an image, which is used in TactileView to create the graphic.
